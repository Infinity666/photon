Utility
=======

This is the toolbox used by :ref:`core`:

.. seealso:: |allcore|

As well as used by the :ref:`tools`:

.. seealso:: |alltools|

.. note:: If you have no explicit reason, do **not** use the functions here directly.

    * Always try to work trough :class:`photon.Photon` and it's handlers.
    * If you discover you are repeatedly calling backend functions consider adding a tool for that job!
